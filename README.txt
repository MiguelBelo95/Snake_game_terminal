My first repository for a game using python. A classic snake game.

USAGE: Please make sure you have python3 installed on your computer. Download the files from the git_snake repository (snake_py, snake_score.txt, terminalInput.py). The game is intended to run  on your terminal.Use the command python3 snake.py, the game will run there. Use the keys W,A,S,D to steer the snake along the invisible grid. If the snake collides against its own body, the game is over.
       

I hope you have fun and share your thoughts on how I should improve the game :)
